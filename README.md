# 🐾 Save A Dog: SQL Database Project

This project models a relational database system for a dog adoption center. It was developed in **IST-659: Data Administration Concepts and Database Management** as part of the M.S. in Applied Data Science program at Syracuse University. The database is designed to support efficient dog-to-adopter matching, centralized data storage, and accurate record keeping.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- **Built from scratch** using SQL: table creation, foreign keys, inserts, data validation
- **Normalized structure** with support for many-to-many relationships
- **Entity-relationship and logical data modeling**
- **Business-focused requirements** including adoption status tracking, vaccination records, and breed metadata
- **SQL queries** for analysis and validation

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- SQL (DDL & DML)
- Relational database design
- Normalization and referential integrity
- ERD and schema documentation
- Practical application of data privacy and system design concepts

## 📂 Key Tables

- `dog`, `adopter`, `applications`, `vaccination_record`
- `dog_listing`, `dog_breed`, `dog_image`
- Relationship tables: `dog_breed_x_dog`, `dog_image_x_dog`
